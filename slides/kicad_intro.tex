  \frametitle{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Components, Boards and Firmware
    \item Open Hardware addresses entire stack
    \item Board (PCB) design is "drawing"
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{KiCAD}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Developed by CERN
    \item Current version 4.0.*
    \item Next version (5.0) just around the corner
    \item Open ecosystem around components \& footprints
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Workflow}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Schematics (represent Circuits)
    \item Associate Footprints
    \item Layout boards \& route traces
    \item Repeat for iterations
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Schematics}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Symbols (Create missing symbols)
    \item Labels
    \item Connections
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Schematics Workflow}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Create circuit schematic
    \item Annotate (Give components unique names)
    \item Associate footprints
    \item Export Netlist
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Board Layout}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Import Netlist
    \item Layout components
